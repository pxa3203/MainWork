<h2 style="color:red;font-size:22px;">Personal Information</h2>    
<p>Student #3773064</p>
<p>Contact email: 3773064@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
<p>I am from Seattle, Washington! That's in the Pacific Northwest of the United States! </p>
<p>The highest level of education I have completed is a High School Diploma, I am a first year at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. </p>
<p>I speak English and I am moderately proficient at Spanish. </p>
<p>I moved to Melbourne on the 13th of February 2020. I am a Full-Time International Student and not on an exchange program. </p>
<p>I love to fly my drones and for I am an Amateur Boxer. As well I do some day-trading of stocks. </p>
<h3 style="color:red;font-size:22px;">Interest in IT</h3>
<p>My interest in IT springs from my father. From a young age I remember working on cars and always wanting to know how things work. That interest extends into IT and I have been in love ever since my father introduced me to computers. </p>
<p>My IT experience is limited to neighbourhood consultations. My neighbours in Seattle own and operate a concrete cutting company. I make IT related recommendations to them based on their specific needs. </p>
<p>I chose RMIT because of the great reputation we have for Information Technology. As well the location being in the city really appealed to me being from the city back home. </p>
<p>Over my three years at RMIT I expect to learn practical concepts that will prepare me to pursue and create a career in Information Technology. I am looking forward to what RMIT has to offer. </p>
<h4 style="color:red;font-size:22px;">Ideal Job</h4>
<p>The ideal IT job for me would be within the Cyber Security field. Specifically, I would like to work in the Cyber Risk department for a large organization. I found a job listing for Microsoft in Seattle where they are looking for a Cyber Risk Analyst. </p>

  </p>
<p>The position is a higher-level position within Microsoft's cyber security division. The position is responsible for making crucial and high-pressure decisions to best protect Microsoft and their customers. I believe the critical thinking and leadership needs would tailor to my abilities well. </p>
<p>The qualifications required for this position are 2 years (or more) of Cyber Security related work. However mainly they are interested in people who can remain calm in high-pressure situations and effectively communicate the situation to peers. Strong IT fundamentals and networking experience is a benefit when applying for the position. Lastly, they are looking for someone that is interesting in their work and are passionate to always be learning. </p>
<p>My qualifications are currently limited. I have informal IT consulting experience and a lot of experience working with people. I developed most of my soft skills by working at the front desk of a hotel and interacting with the general public 40 hours per week. I am able to deescalate tense situations and think crucial during those situations. </p>
<p>I plan on graduating from RMIT with a Bachelor of Information of Technology in November of 2022. During the summers between years of University I would like to take part in 2 internships. I will use those internships to gain knowledge and self-reflect on what I can do better. I will also tailor of soft skills to a professional environment and continue to improve them. After graduation I would like to find an entry-level Cyber Security position that will let me gain knowledge in the field. This will allow me to grow my skill set, begin my career, and possibly get some positive references to have when applying for a higher position later in life. </p>
<h5 style="color:red;font-size:22px;">Profile</h5>
<p style= "color:red;font-size:14px;">Myers-Briggs Results:</p>
<p>My Myers-Briggs test results were very eye opening to me. I used "16personalities.com" to take my test. It is based on the Myer-Briggs model. The test indicated that I am a "consul" and a personality code of "ESFJ-T". A consul is someone that is very practical and very loyal. The weakness of a consul are often being inflexible and being too selfless. After taking the test I can see myself having each of these traits. I am more a logic thinker and follow my mind more than I follow my heart. I am also much more observant than I am intuitive which explains why I like to have an organized itinerary before participating in activities. I think it is apparent that when working in a team I would be the problem solver and the one that keeps everything organized. I think I would inform the group of my strength and my weaknesses so they can understand where I am most useful. If everyone knows what everyone is capable of, work becomes a lot more efficient. </p>
<p style= "color:red;font-size:14px;">Learning Styles Results:</p>
<p>I have previous knowledge that I was a tactile learner and this test confirmed it. I used "educationplanner.org" to complete the learning styles test and it reported that I am 40% tactile, 30% Auditory, and 30% visual when it comes to learning subjects. I can confirm personally that I learn the best when I can pick something up in my hands or work on it personally compared to studying a book or listening to someone talk about it. I think in a group I would be the hardware based one I would let my group know that from the beginning. I think this knowledge would help my behaviour within a team because I know that I need to work with my hands, compared to another group member who may be more inclined to listen to someone explain something or watch someone complete a task.</p>
<p style= "color:red;font-size:14px;">Big Five Personality Results:</p>
<p>I took the "Big Five Personality Test" from "Truity.com". The test is based off 5 letters known at "OCEAN". The O stands for openness, C stands for conscientiousness, E stands for extraversion, A stands for agreeableness, N stands for neuroticism. My two highest letters by far were C and E. The tests showed me that I am very logical, and I like things to be organized and in their place. Like the first two tests, this test also showed me that I am very outgoing and like to talk to people. I am strong in social situations and can talk to anyone. I think when working in a group I would be good at breaking the ice between members when we first meet and need to work together. I can always find something to talk about and it comes very naturally. I automatically start up conversation in groups. When forming a group, I would take this into account and ask people if they like to talk while they work. If people don't like to talk, all I will do is annoy them and neither one of us will get work done. </p>
<h6 style="color:red;font-size:22px;">Project Ideas</h6>
<p>The idea for my project is based off my hobby of investing in stocks. My project would be a bot that could invest in the market on its own, always reading prices, buying and selling at a rate where it makes up for the margin of the trading fee. Ideally it would start with penny stocks and about twenty dollars, investing little by little and selling for about a 2 cent profit each time. If the stock fell by a certain percentage, it would automatically sell the stock and cut the losses. It would be used with small amounts of money allowing the user to understand the portfolio trends, as well as the markets trends. </p>
<p>My motivation for this project originally comes from my hobby of investing into stocks. I have been fascinated with the stock market ever since I was about 4 years old. I have asked my father thousands of questions about the market and how it operates, theirs always more to learn. It is hard to keep track of hundreds of stocks at a time however a bot could scan the whole market relatively quickly. Using smaller amounts of money could allow someone to study the trends of the market with little consequence. It can run on inexpensive hardware and only needs an internet connection. It could be setup initially and not have to be monitored after that. </p>
<p>The Stock Trader Bot would be comprised of many features. From the perspective of the user one would be an intuitive and easily assessible GUI web interface. Within the web interface would where the user configures the bot to their liking. The user would setup their margins for where they would like the bot to buy the stocks and where it would like them to sell the stock. The user would need to decide the margin on where the stock would sell all the stock if the stock were to fall. As well when the bot would sell the stock at a profit. The user would also be able to choose stocks the bot would be able to invest in, or perhaps the user would like the bot to read the whole market. Within the web interface would also be a summary of the portfolio by hour, day, week, month, and year. Within the summary the user should be able to see which stocks have performed well and which have not. Also, within the summary would the total gain/loss over the selected duration of time. Relevant news impacting the stock market would also be present within the web interface. News is very important when trading stocks and can help explain changes in the market, whether there is a global pandemic, or a company has had a changing of their Chief Executive Officer. The bot would also be able chart out the data to make it easier for the user to understand how their money is being manipulated and how it has performed. It is unrealistic to expect ever user to be a financial analyst therefore the design of the interface is extremely important. People protect their money and only put it where it can be safe, a confusing interface can create uncertainty within the mind of the user that could lead them to withdraw from the platform. The web interface would ask users for their feedback to help us improve the platform. What the user wants and needs should be our priority, because without users we are nothing. I have talked a lot about the user and how we plan to tailor the platform to them. However, we also need to protect them. Their money needs to be safe and in a reliable place. We would take our users security as a top priority to help ensure our data is kept internally and only accessible in necessary situations. The data collected from the user will always be available for them to view. They will be able to see how much data we have collected, what that data is, and how/where we are using it. Data is becoming more valuable day by day and we should have complete transparency with our users on how their data is being used. Lastly, our service would have to be paid for. Our payment would come up front month by month or taken as a fee in each trade. This gives the user total control over the way they would like to pay and setup the bot accordingly. </p>
<p>The platform could run off an inexpensive Raspberry Pi. All it needs is an internet connection to interface with. To trade stocks the platform would have to be certified through the governing body in the country of operation. For Australia that would be the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). This can be a lengthy and expensive process to get your business setup correctly and being able to legally operate. I am unaware of any open source tools that could help us. We would also need access to an exchange that lists the price of a stock and when it sells. </p>
<p>The skills required would be primarily software based. We would need HTML5 developing tools to make the web interface and probably C# experience for the back end. The special hardware would just be the Raspberry Pi, this would not be hard or expensive to obtain. Our backend software would need to be written from scratch and so would our front-end HTML. At this point it is not feasible to do the C# because I have no experience with it at all. The HTML would also be a challenge. However, I do have experience with a Raspberry Pi and I know a lot of helpful tricks, therefore that would be the easiest for us to work with.</p>
<p>One major outcome is getting people into trading stocks who are either unable to do it themselves, or do not want to do it themselves. Instead of paying high fees for a physical person to monitor your portfolio you could pay a smaller fee for a bot to invest. Lastly, the platform could be used to collect further data about the market and help educate professionals and the general public. </p>
